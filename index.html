  <center><h1>2011 World Series Game 6</h1></center>
<p align="left">The 2011 World Series was a thrilling contest between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Texas Rangers. The pivotal point of this series came in Game 6, with the Rangers having won 3 of the first 5 games and sitting on the brink of glory. The Rangers took a 7-5 lead into the 9th inning, and had the Cardinals down to their final out. With runners on first and second, David Freese faced a 1-2 count with the game, and their season, on the line. The pitch came in, and chaos began.</p>
<p align="left">Freese, who was 0-3 on the night, smashed a line drive to right field, driving both runs in to tie the game with a clutch triple. The game moved onto extra innings, and the Cardinals found themselves down to their last strike yet again, this time with Lance Berkman at the plate. He drove a single into center, scoring two runs on yet another clutch hit for the Cards. With the game tied in the bottom of the 11th inning, David Freese stepped up to the plate yet again. What happened next is written in Cardinals lore for eternity.</p>
<p align="left">The St. Louis native sent the ball soaring over the fence in center field, completing an epic comeback. Cardinals fans rejoiced as their team went on to win game 7 to win their 11th World Series. The drama of this series may never be replicated, and Game 6 is definitely one of the greatest games ever played.</p>
